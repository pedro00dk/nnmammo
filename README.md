Neural network mammography database analysis
============================================

## Needed software and packages:

* Python 3.6.x (preferably anaconda distribution, https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* scikit-learn (already installed in anaconda distribution)
* jupyter and derived (already installed in anaconda distribution)
* imbalanced-learn (conda install -c glemaitre imbalanced-learn)

Script modifications should be made in the nnmammo.py, the python comments \# \<markdowncell\>, \# \<codecell\>, \# \<rawcell\> can be used to format the script and automatically generate a jupyter notebook. This configuration allows easier versioning and debugging.
* notebook generation (script -> notebook): python script2notebook.py
